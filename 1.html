    <h3>What did I do during my winter break?</h3>

    <p>
      This winter break felt very chill for me. Most of the time, I relaxed and
      cooked food, which is one of my favorite activities. I stayed with my mom
      during the winter break and was free to cook the food I like without any
      restrictions.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">
      My favorite activity was going to my relatives’ house for parties. I met
      many people I knew from Vietnam again and enjoyed a lot of delicious food.
